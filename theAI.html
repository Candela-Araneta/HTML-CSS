    <h2> What artificial intelligence (AI) is? </h2>
        <p> Artificial Intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.</p>
    <h3> The way it works. </h3>
        <p> AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, analyzing the data for correlations and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states.</p>
        <p> A chatbot that is fed examples of text can learn to generate lifelike exchanges with people, or an image recognition tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images by reviewing millions of examples. New, rapidly improving generative AI techniques can create realistic text, images, music and other media.</p>
        <p> AI programming focuses on cognitive skills that include: Learning, by acquiring data and creating rules (algorithms) for how to provide computing devices with step-by-step instructions to complete a specific task; Reasoning, by choosing the right algorithm to reach a desired outcome; Self-correction, to continually fine-tune algorithms that ensure they provide the most accurate results posible and Creativity, by use of neural networks, rules-based systems, statistical methods and other AI techniques to generate new images, new text, new music and new ideas.</p>
    <h4> Programming languages: looking for efficiency. </h4>
        <p> AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms. No single programming language is synonymous with AI, but Python, R, Java, C++ and Julia have features popular with AI developers.</p>
